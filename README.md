# Battery-monitor

**Theory**

*This is a arduino project using battery, Charging monitor(arduino) and DPST to turn of or on the supply by reading the percentage.*


**Demonstration**
```
We can also do edit for various battery values like 1.5V, 6V, 9V, 12V batteries as, 
in battery chemistry we see that for example lets take 12V battery for example at minimum drops to 10.5 V and maximum charges upto 12V so,
if(10.5 < v < 12)
Vrating = 12V;
so we can change the values in the code instead of 5V to 12V.
